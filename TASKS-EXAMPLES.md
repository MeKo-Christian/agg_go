## Notes

- Files marked with `.h` are header files that define interfaces and templates
- Files marked with `.cpp` are implementation files
- Some headers are template-only and may not have corresponding .cpp files
- Platform-specific files can be implemented as needed for target platforms
- The GPC library may need special licensing consideration
- Font support files are optional depending on text rendering requirements
